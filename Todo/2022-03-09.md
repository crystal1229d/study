## TODO 2022-03-09 (WED)

Today is gloomy, worrying presidential election day. 
<br>
While we (I + my sister + her husband) are heading for middle school to vote, my father goes camping with my cousins.
<br>
After election, I actually planned to visit IKEA in Goyang but instead of shopping there, I and my sister eat breads we bought from Peterpan Bakery and then play 'Vivid Night' at Steam with Chobom Heo.
