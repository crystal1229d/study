It's not my fault that I don't study hard recently. 
Kairo has released it's new game, '24h convenience store story' so I have to play it since yesterday.
At work, i'm busy a lot but it's enough to enjoy good weather. 
I have several meetings and have lunch outside (noodle) with women and my boss buy us ice cream.

I woke up really late this morning. 
When I was brushing my teeth in the middle of work, I heard a crash of something.
The frame with a photo on the cabinet fell off with a light and the light broke.
I pick up all the broken pieces and cleaned my room.
