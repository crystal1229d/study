I don't know why but I'm full of energy today. <br>

## TODO 2022-03-30 (WED)

I suddenly have meeting with KIS tomorrow morning. <br>
When it comes to communication and something like that, it starts to become really hard. <br>
I'm too worried and depressed all day long. No energy to work or study. <br>
I can barely take a hot shower at night and then take some lectures at Udemy.

## TODO 2022-03-31 (THUR)

It's so busy and tiring day. <br>
I woke up very early at morning, put some make up and then went to work. <br>
I was very busy at work because of meeting with KIS (although it'd been called off) and other difficult problems. <br>
After work, I visited HYUNDAE department store at Shindorim subway station. <br>
I shopped for clothes and groceries there. I put on approximately 40 clothes, but got only 2 clothes which go well with me.
