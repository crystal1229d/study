## TODO 2022-03-26 (SAT)

It's too hard to wake up early these days. <br>
I woke up at 09:00 because I received two phone calls, 
one from my sister's husband and another one from my boss. <br>
I successfully dealt with the problem in short time. <br>
After all the things tied up loose ends, I went to bed again. <br>
