I was anxious about work at early morning but finished with it on time.
So I and my colleagues take a walk toward famouse cafe at Gasan through cherry blossom way. Wind is blowing softly and cherry blossom leaves is scattering everywhere. Despite coffee and bakery is not as delicious as I expected but it was good enough.
