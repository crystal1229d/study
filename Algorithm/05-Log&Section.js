    Section 1. Big O Notation

    1-5 Logarithms 

    =============================


    <Why Learn Logarithms?>
    We've encountered some of the most common complexities: O(1), O(n), O(n²)
    Sometimes big O expressions involve more complex mathematical expressions.
    One that appears more often than you might like is the logarithm!


    <What is Log (Logarithms)?>
    log₂(8) = 3             =>        2³ = 8
    log 2 base of 8 equals 3

    log₂(value) = exponent  =>        2exponent = value


    We'll omit the 2.
    log === log₂



    <Logarithm Complexity>
    Logarithm time complexity is great.
    알고리즘이 log n 시간 복잡도를 갖고있다면 아주 좋은 것.
    가파른 정도 : O(n²) > o(nlog n) > O(n) > O(log n) > O(1)



    <Who Cares?>
