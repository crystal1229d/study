## Section 3. Algirithms & Problem Solving Patterns

### 3-1 Introduction 

---

#### < Objectives >
- Define what an algorithm is
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms
- Compare and contrast problem solving patterns 
    including frequency counters, two pointer problems 
    and dive and conquer (빈도 카운터, 투 포인터, 분할정복)

<br>
#### < What is an ALGORITHM? >
A __process__ or __set of steps__ to accomplish a certain task

<br>
#### < Why do I need to know this? >
Almost __everything__ that you do in programming involved some kind of __algorithm__
__It's the <U>foundation</U> for being a successful problem solving and developer__

<br>
#### < How do you improve? >
1. __Devise__ a plan for solving problems
2. __Master__ common problem solving patterns

<br>
#### < Problem Solving >
1. Understand the Problem       문제 이해
2. Explore Concrete Examples    구체적 예시 조사
3. Break it Down                문제 세분화
4. Solve / Simplify             문제 해결 / 단순화
5. Look Back and Refactor       복습 / 재구성
