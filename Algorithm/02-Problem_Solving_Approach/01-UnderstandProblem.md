## Section 3. Algirithms & Problem Solving Approach

### 3-2 Understand the Problem

---

#### < Understand the Problem >
1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
    문제를 내 방식대로 다시 생각할 수 있는가? = 문제를 실제로 이해
2. What are the __inputs__ that go into the problem?
3. What are the __outputs__ that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. __Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?__
    In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? <br>(You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem.<br>That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
    문제를 해결할 충분한 정보가 주어졌는가?
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
    문제에서 정말 중요한 것은 무엇인가? 어떤 용어를 사용해야하는가?

<br>
#### < Example >
```
[Problem] Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum
```
```
[Process]
1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
implement addition (숫자를 더하거나 덧셈을 수행하는 함수 작성)

2. What are the inputs?
two numbers 
// ints?
// floats?
// what about string for large numbers?

3. What are the outputs?
// int? float? string?

4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?

5. How should I label the important pieces of data?
