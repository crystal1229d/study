    < BUILT-IN DATA STRUCTURES through the lens of Big O >

    Now that we've covered Big O,
    Let's spend a couple minutes analyzing the things we do all the time in JS:
    working with Arrays, Objects, and built-in methods.

    

    < OBJECTIVES >
    * Understand how objects and arrays work, through the lens of Big O
    * Explain why adding elements to the beginning of an array is costly (좋지 않은 이유 + 더 좋은 대안 + 배열 처리 시간 비교)
    * Compare and contrast the runtime for arrays and objects, as well as built-in methods
        (example of built-in methods) : sort, forEach, Object.key, Object.hasOwnProperty, ...
